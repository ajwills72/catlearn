\title{

    Simulation of sorting behaviour from Experiment 1 in
    Medin, Wattenmaker and Hampson (1987) with the SUSTAIN
    model (Love, Medin and Gureckis, 2004).

}

\description{

    Runs a simulation of Experiment 1 in Medin et al. (1987)
    using the \code{\link{slpSUSTAIN}} model implementation and
    \code{\link{medin87train}} as the input representation.

\usage{medin87sustain(params = c(9.998779, 6.396300, 1.977312, 0.096564, 0.5),
       seed = 7649)}

\arguments{

    \item{params}{A vector containing values for r, beta, d, and eta, tau in
        that order, e.g. params = c(8.1, 1.5, 9.71, 0.8). See
        \code{\link{slpSUSTAIN}} for an explanation of these parameters.}
    \item{seed}{}
}

\value{
    
    A matrix of lambda values with columns for each dimension 
    (D1, D2, D3, D4) and the last columnfor sorting strategies 
    (1 = family resemblance, 0 = unidimensional),
    with each row representing a simulated participant.

\details{

    NOTE: In catlearn version 0.7, the underlying slpSUSTAIN function is
    written in R, and hence this simulation can take several minutes to
    run. A goal for version 0.8 is to re-write slpSUSTAIN in C++, which
    will reduce the run time of this simulation to a few seconds.

    Participants in Medin et al. (1987) recieved the items all
    at once in a randomly scrambled order and were allowed to scrutinize
    each before sorting them into two piles. Love et al. (2004) presented
    the 10 trial types to SUSTAIN in a random order for 10 training blocks
    to mirror human participants' ability to examine the items.

    Additionally, in the Love et al. (2004) simulation, SUSTAIN was restricted
    to create a maximum of two clusters. This functionality was introduced
    with an optional \code{maxcat} parameter for unsupervised learning, which
    was similarly set to 2 for this simulation. For more explanation of
    \code{maxcat}, see \code{\link{slpSUSTAIN}}.

    The simulation uses 1000 simulated participants. Like described in
    Love et al. (2004), all simulated participants complete 10 unsupervised
    training block. Other parameters of slpSUSTAIN are set as follows:
    \code{lambda} = 1, initial \code{w} = 0, initial cluster centered on 
    the first stimulus presented to the simulated participant.

    Sorting strategies are evaluated on the cluster level in a similar
    way to Love et al. (2004). Each dimension of a cluster is compared
    to the other dimensions, which shows us how SUSTAIN organized
    cluster representations along the dimensions. In the comparison,
    we tolerated a limit of 0.1 difference. If  the difference between
    dimensions was smaller than 0.1, than the strategy was classified
    as family resemblance (omnidimensional), otherwise it was
    classified as unidimensional.

    Love et al. (2004) reported, that SUSTAIN used a unidimensional
    strategy 99\% of the time, and family resemblance 1\% of the time.
    The current simulation with 1000 simulated participants reports 
    a unidimensional strategy at 89.2\% of the times, and family
    resemblance at 10.7\% of the times.
