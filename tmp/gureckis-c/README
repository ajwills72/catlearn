	 hi Andy,

	 I actually can’t find the full SUSTAIN code base from the original
	 paper on my local computer. It is probably on some type of backup
	 someplace. I fear a zip disk which I couldn’t even open now anyway
	 without buying a vintage zip disc drive! ;) However, I did find an
	 email from 2009 where i sent the SUSTAIN c++ bits to someone else. I’m
	 attaching here the message I sent to this person as it is about as
	 accurate as I can remember of the situation.

	 So, yes, this is the SUSTAIN c++ code I used (see SUSTAINNetwork.cpp
	 as a starting place but it depends on other files in the folder as
	 well). This should provide one additional basis for comparison between
	 the python code and what was in the paper.

	 re: the code sharing of cognitive models…

	 There was no reason that it didn’t take off. I think Brad and I
	 discussed how lame it was that everyone was always reimplementing the
	 same models and how much work it was to do model comparisons in a
	 paper.  So we were very much thinking in the spirit of what you are
	 doing. We even created a webpage for the code base on Brad’s lab
	 server I think but in an age before GitHub, OSF, code sharing or
	 discussions about computational reproducibility it was just an oddity
	 perhaps. Now you could write a grant to some agency and maybe get
	 money to support such an effort but a while back is seemed it was just
	 a nice thing to do with no benefit beyond the hypothetical savings of
	 other people’s time!
