* TODO training matrix
** TODO queried/missing dimensions choosable
This is necessary for fitting billman96 to SUSTAIN. This can be added as a t
column at the end of the training matrix, that is used when learning is
freezed.
*** NOTE queried dimensions 
During the learning phase,
category dimension is always the last. I think it is not a big problem,
because in the problem space, SUSTAIN would treat queried dimension as
a category dimension, regarldess of which it was in the experiment 
(category or ) 
*** NOTE billman test phase
The problem is that, during the training phase aprticipants completed the 
two-forced-choice match-to-standard task, but with one dimension missing
from each stimuli. In the original simulation, lambda of the missing 
dimension was set to zero, so it did not affect the
