Actually, I looked at the simulation and now seemsto have discovered a bug on 
line 72 in slpSUSTAIN which occurs only if colskip is bigger then 1 in case 
of an unsupervised learning condition. It calculates the queried dimensions 
the same way for both conditions. So even if learning is unsupervised, it 
extracts the last columns which will be st$dims + 1.
