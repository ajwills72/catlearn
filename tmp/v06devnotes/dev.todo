##########

[x] looking at writing functions for cluster activations
[ ] modifying colskip, so it is consistent with the other functions
[x] tweak nosof94train() and ask Andy if that is okay

- output refinement
[x] include probability of making the right response for nominal values
[x] include output activation for queried dimensions ot all of it in unsup
[x] everything that changes
[ ] add colnames for w, clusters, probabilities, etc.

- supervised bug
[x] wrong cluster activations
[x] updating clusters?
[x] type3 problem is not doing that well
    instead of the first two dimension, lambda leans toward
    the second and third dimension, so it recruits seven clusters
    instead of six, but it might be right

- unsupervised adjustments:
[x] probabilities

- frozen learning
[x] 'ctrl' coloumn 0, 1, 2
    > 0 = training trial
    > 1 = reset state
    > 2 = freeze learning
[x] xout[i] = 99 if ctrl = 2 !!it does NA instead

- documentation
[?] whatnot
[x] ctrl coloumn update
[x] values update
[x] hyphens are processed as question marks in ASCII
[x] weights description
[ ] corrections required where comments appear
[ ] specify that SUSTAIN treats categories as another dimension
[ ] reviewing documentation so that everything is included clearly
[ ] add line-breaks in slpSUSTAIN.Rd
