Hi, 

I've just released 'catlearn', a free and open archive designed to
facilitate collaboration on the formal modeling of psychological
processes, see:

http://catlearn.r-forge.r-project.org/

You can also join the mailing list at: 

https://lists.r-forge.r-project.org/mailman/listinfo/catlearn-package

Catlearn is intended to be a community-sourced archive of model
implementations, and independently-replicated data sets against which
to test them, and also an archive of those simulations. The project is
discussed in detail in a forthcoming "Psychology of Learning and
Motivation" article - a copy is available on request. I'm also happy
to give a presentation or workshop if that would be of interest.

Finally, I'm particularly keen to talk to you, and assist, if...

* You have a formal model you'd like to make publicly available in
this archive. I have already implemented ALCOVE with the archive, and
we're working on COVIS.

* You have ideas for independently-replicated phenomena that could
  be included in the archive.

* You'd like to publicly archive your simulations of datasets with
  models. 

All the best
