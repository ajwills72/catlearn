Hi,

Version 1.0 of the 'catlearn' package is now available.

Catlearn is an archive of fourteen formal models of categorization and
learning. It's free and open source software ... and always will be. It has
been downloaded 37,000 times.

Version 1.0 is an upgrade release with one new model (DGCM, in both the original 
Stewart & Morin, 2007, form and the more recent O'Bryan et al., 2018, form),
and one model upgrade (SUSTAIN, which now reports the probability that a 
presented stimulus is 'old'). 

Catlearn is a package for R, and is very easy to install within that
environment. Make sure you're running the latest version of R, and then type:

install.packages('catlearn')

and then

library(catlearn).

For a tutorial introduction to catlearn, see Wills et al. (2017). There is also 
information here:

Thanks to all the contributors to catlearn, and particular thanks to Lenard
Dome who contributed new code for the version 1.0 release.

All the best

Andy
