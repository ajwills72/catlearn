Hi,

Version 0.9.1 of the 'catlearn' package is now available.

Catlearn is an archive of thirteen formal models of categorization and
learning. It's free and open source software ... and always will be. It has
been downloaded 32,000 times.

Version 0.9.1 is an upgrade release with two new models (Models 4 and 5 from
Paskewitz & Jones, 2020), and (non-breaking) improvements to the Gluck & Bower
(1988) implementation. 

Catlearn is a package for R, and is very easy to install within that
environment. Make sure you're running the latest version of R, and then type:

install.packages('catlearn')

and then

library(catlearn).

For a tutorial introduction to catlearn, and the Open Models initiative more
generally, see Wills et al. (2017). There is also information here:

Thanks to all the contributors to catlearn, and particular thanks to Lenard
Dome who contributed new code for the version 0.9.1 release.

All the best

Andy
