Hi,

Version 0.4 of 'catlearn' is now available for Windows, Mac, and
Linux. This update adds three model implementations:

* COVIS (Ashby et al., 1998) - lead programmer: Angus Inkster
* DIVA (Kurtz, 2007)         - lead programmer: Garrett Honke
* Rescorla-Wagner (1972)     - lead programmer: Stuart Spicer

'catlearn' is a free and open archive of model implementations, data
sets, and simulations, designed to facilitate collaboration on the
formal modeling of psychological processes, see:

http://catlearn.r-forge.r-project.org/

If you are going to the ICPS conference in Vienna this month, you
might like to attend the half-way workshop I'm running on catlearn:

A Practical Introduction to Distributed Collaboration for Formal
Modeling
ICPS, Vienna
Thu, Mar 23, 10:30am - 1:20pm, Hall N2.

You can also join the mailing list at: 

https://lists.r-forge.r-project.org/mailman/listinfo/catlearn-package

Finally, I'm particularly keen to talk to you, and assist, if...

* You have a formal model you'd like to make publicly available in
this archive. 

* You have ideas for independently-replicated phenomena that could
  be included in the archive.

* You'd like to publicly archive your simulations of datasets with
  models. 

All the best
