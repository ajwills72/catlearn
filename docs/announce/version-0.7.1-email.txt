Hi,

Version 0.7.1 of the 'catlearn' package is now available.

Catlearn is an archive of ten formal models of categorization and
learning. It's free and open source software ... and always will be. It has
been downloaded 13,000 times.

Version 0.7.1 is an upgrade release with one new model (Mackintosh, 1975),
speed improvements for the EXIT model (Kruschke, 2001) and functionality
improvements for SUSTAIN (Love et al., 2004) model.

Catlearn is a package for R, and is very easy to install within that
environment. Make sure you're running the latest version of R, and then type:

install.packages('catlearn')

and then

library(catlearn).

For a tutorial introduction to catlearn, and the Open Models initiative more
generally, see Wills et al. (2017). There is also information here:

Thanks to all the contributors to catlearn, and particular thanks to Lenard
Dome and Ren√© Schlegelmlich, who both contributed new code for the version
0.7.1 release.

All the best

Andy
