Hi,

Version 0.6.1 of the 'catlearn' package is now available.

Catlearn is an archive of formal models of categorization and
learning, plus benchmark datasets to test them against. It's also an
archive of simulations using those models. It's free and open source
software ... and always will be.

Version 0.6.1 is a maintenance release with a series of minor
enhancements to existing functions.

Catlearn is a package for R, and is very easy to install within that
environment. Make sure you're running the latest version of R, and
then type:

install.packages('catlearn')

and then

library(catlearn).

For a tutorial introduction to catlearn, and the Open Models
initiative more generally, see Wills et al. (2017).

Thanks to all the contributors to catlearn, and particular thanks to
Angus Inkster and Lenard Dome, who both contributed new code for
the version 0.6.1 release.

All the best

Andy
