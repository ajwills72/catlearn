# catlearn
Formal Psychological Models of Categorization and Learning

This is the _unstable_ release of catlearn (formely hosted on R-forge). If you're not sure what "usntable" means in this context, 
you probably want to install the **stable** version instead, from CRAN, by typing:

`install.packages("catlearn") into the R console.

If you're sure you want the unstable version, first install devtools and its dependencies. Then run:

`devtools::install_github("matsukik/grt")`
