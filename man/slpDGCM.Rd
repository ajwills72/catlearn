  Similarity-Dissimilarity Generalized Context Model (DGCM)
}

\description{
  Stewart and Morin (2007)'s extension to Nosofsky's (1984, 2011) Exemplar-based
  Generalized Context Model. The implementation also
  contains O'Bryan et al. (2018)'s version of the Similarity-Dissimilarity
  Generalized Context Model, see Note 1.

\usage{
  slpDGCM(st, test, dec = "BIAS", exemplar_mute = FALSE, exemplar_decay = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{st}{List of model parameters}
  \item{test}{Test matrix.}
  \item{dec}{Decision mechanism. If \code{NOISE}, use O'Bryan et al. (2018)'s
             background-noise decision rule. If \code{BIAS} (default), use
             Stewart and Morin (2007)'s category-bias decision rule.}
  \item{exemplar_mute}{If \code{TRUE}, only those exemplars contribute evidence
                       to the decision rule, which have at least one feature
                       common with the current stimuli (O'Bryan et al., 2018).
                       If \code{FALSE} (default), all exemplars contribute.}
  \item{exemplar_decay}{If \code{TRUE} (default), exemplar weightings decay
                        as specified by Stewart and Morin (2007). If
                        \code{FALSE}, exemplar weightings are static.}

}

\value{

  If \code{exemplar_decay = FALSE}, returns a list of the following matrices:

  \code{v} A matrix of evidence accumulated for each category (columns) on each
  trial (rows) as output by Equation 3 in Stewart and Morin (2007).

  \code{p} A matrix of response probabilities. Category responses (columns) for each trial (rows).

  If \code{exemplar_decay = TURE}, the function also returns memory decay for
  each trial, \code{decay}.

}

\details{

This implementation houses the two version of DGCM.
In order to use the instantiation of DGCM described in O'Bryan et al.
(2018), set \code{exemplar_decay = FALSE} and \code{exemplar_mute = TRUE}.
The default settings of the function will run the model that corresponds
to Stewart and Morin (2007).

The functions works as a stateful list processor.Specifically, it
takes a data frame as an argument, where each row is one trial for the
model, and the columns specify the input representation, teaching
signals, and other control signals. It returns two matrices containing, for each trial,
response probabilities and the accumulated evidence for each category.
It also returns the final state of the network (e.g. memory decay),
hence its description as a 'stateful' list processor, see Note 1.

\code{st} must be a list containing the following items:

\code{attentional_weights} -  vector of attentional weights, where sum of all elements equal to 1.

\code{c} - generalization constant.

\code{r} - The Minkowski metric parameter \emph{r} gives a city block metric when
           r = 1 (used for separable-dimension stimuli) and a Euclidean metric when
           r = 2 (used for integral-dimension stimuli).

\code{s} - similarity and dissimilarity weighting. If 0, evidence for a category will be
           purely based on the dissimilarity between current input vector and all exemplars
           from the other categories. If it is 1, evidence for a given category will be
           solely based on similarity to its own exemplars.

\code{t} - exemplar weighting. If \code{memory_decay = FALSE}, it is a vector of
           exemplar-specific memory strength. If  \code{memory_decay = TRUE} (default),
           it is a vector of exemplar-specific memory strengths that will update according
           to the function as specified in Equation 4 in Stewart and Morin (2007).

\code{beta} - category bias vector. Only used when \code{dec} set to BIAS, otherwise ignored.
            Currently, there is no restriction in place on what values are allowed in this implementation,
            but Stewart and Morin (2007) specifies that elements of \code{beta} should sum to 1.

\code{base} - a vector of baseline level of similarity. This parameter will control how much noise will
           spread over all categories in the background-noise decision rule. It is only
           used if \code{dec} is set to NOISE.

\code{gamma} - decision scaling constant. Only used when \code{dec} is set to BIAS.

\code{theta} - decay rate. If \code{exemplar_decay = FALSE}, theta is ignored. 

\code{colskip} - the number of optional columns to skip in test plus one. If you have
no optional columns, set it to one.

\code{outcomes} - the number of categories.

\code{exemplars} - a matrix of exemplars and their corresponding category indicated by a single integer.

\code{test} must be a \code{data.matix} with the following columns:

\code{opt1, opt2, \dots} - any number of optional columns, the
    names of which can be chosen by the user. These optional columns
    are ignored by the slpDGCM function, but you may wish to use them for readability.

\code{x1, x2, x3, \dots}- {input to the model, there must be one column for
each input unit. Each row is one trial.}

\note{

1. O'Bryan et al. (2018)'s version of the DGCM is not a stateful list processor, but
we decided to include it in the same implementation. In fact, Stewart and Morin
(2007)'s version only classifies as a stateful list processor, because of the memory
decay function.
